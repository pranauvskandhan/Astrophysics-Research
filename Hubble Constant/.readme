# Supernova Cosmology with Pantheon+SH0ES

This project analyzes the Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia Supernova dataset under the ΛCDM cosmological model to constrain the Hubble constant (H₀) and matter density parameter (Ωₘ).

## Key Results
- H₀ = 72.97 ± 0.26 km·s⁻¹·Mpc⁻¹  
- Ωₘ = 0.351 ± 0.019  
- Age of the Universe: ≈ 12.36 Gyr  

## Background
The methodology includes:
1. Data cleaning and selection from Pantheon+SH0ES.  
2. Numerical integration of the luminosity distance.  
3. χ² minimization to fit theoretical distance moduli.  
4. Contour plots for (H₀, Ωₘ) parameter space.  

The results are consistent with SH0ES late-Universe measurements but remain in tension with Planck CMB-based values.

This project was also originally developed under India Space Academy, then extended and refined independently.
